# Maestro Docker Rails Setup

This is the docker + rails app I used to get an app working on Cloud 66

##Â TODO

 - Auto migrations on deploy - https://github.com/cloud66-oss/habitus/tree/master/examples Maybe one of these for that. / https://help.cloud66.com/skycap/how-to-guides/building/building-your-service.html

# Local Setup

Clone down the repo and run:

    bin/setup

This'll setup your local machine for Postgres. To turn on the local server, run:

    rails s
